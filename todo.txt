Some potential future enhancements
- Weighted random selection instead of duplicating values
- Allow for calling a checker function to ensure pre/post conditions. May be redundant with being able to pass functions for getters/setters. Possibly use hooks for this?
- Chained pools where it moves to another after one is exhausted. Not entirely sure on use case here
- Allow for specifying pools with helper constructors - e.g. series of every even number between 0 & 50
- Allow for specifying a min & max and a distribution and for it to automatically handle selecting a value in range (e.g. between 60 & 80 with a guassian distribution)

Some more bug like changes or fixes
- Better error reporting
- Do hashing or better comparison for remove duplicate than serializing
